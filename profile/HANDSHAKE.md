# WARCEU PROJECT COMMUNITY HANDSHAKE  
Version 1.0 — July 2025

This document is a symbolic agreement — a handshake — between active contributors of the Warceu Project.  
It is not a legal contract, but a shared commitment built on trust, solidarity, and the values outlined in `KESPAKATAN_KOMUNITAS.md` (Community Agreement).

We believe that true communities are not built through ownership, but through contribution.  
Not by control, but through cooperation.

## HANDSHAKE STATEMENT

By adding my name below, I declare that:

1. I contribute to the Warceu Project voluntarily and consciously.
2. I support the principles of openness, decentralization, and collective ownership.
3. I will not sell, exploit, or privatize community projects for personal or corporate gain.
4. I commit to community discussion and collective decision-making.
5. I respect the contributions of others, no matter how big or small.
6. I believe this project grows not because of one great individual, but through honest collaboration.
7. I am willing to protect and pass on the spirit of this community to others who wish to learn and contribute.

I understand that this handshake is not legally binding.  
But it is a real commitment — one of purpose, not profit — and I will stand by it.
